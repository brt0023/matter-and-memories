# MATTER AND MEMORIES
## A classic-style space shooter

*******************************************************

### Introduction
You are a space fighter who has been tasked with defending Earth from hordes of interstellar invaders. There are four
different kinds of small ships and two mega-ships that you must defeat in order to win the game.

### Controls
To move your ship, use the WASD keys or the arrow keys (depending on if you are left- or right-handed). To fire your
space weapons, press the space bar.

### Scoring and Health
You will receive one point for each small ship that you defeat. If you are hit by a space weapon or a ship, you will
lose one health point. If you lose eight health points, your ship will be destroyed. If your ship is destroyed eight
times, the game will be over.

Each mega-ship has a health bar. This health bar depletes one point each time your space weapon hits the mega-ship. Once
the mega-ship is destroyed, the stage is complete.

### Space Weapon
Your space weapon has a limited amount of ammunition. As you fire the weapon, the ammunition depletes. The ammunition
will slowly refill while you do not fire the space weapon. Use your ammunition sparingly!

### Notes
This game was developed on an M1 (ARM) Macintosh with 16 GB of RAM. It seems to run more slowly on Intel machines. For
the best possible experience, run this game on a machine with the most horsepower you can find!
